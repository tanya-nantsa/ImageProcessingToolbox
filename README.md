# Image Processing Toolbox

## How To Use
To begin using my toolbox the user must ensure that they are in the current project directory 
which is named “ImageProcessingToolbox”. The user must also ensure they have DearPyGui 
installed by typing ‘pip install dearpygui’ (this was the library used to create the 
graphical user interface). 

Then type ‘python3 ImageToolBox.py’ to launch the toolbox. The application will 
pop up in a new window.

To use the tools in the toolbox the user must first select an image from their 
own files to upload by pressing the “File Selector” button in the application. 
After user must select an image and click the "OK" button.
The next step is to select which tool the user wants to use on the image by 
clicking the corresponding tool button in the application.

To exit the toolbox application, click the X in the top left corner.

## About The Project
This project is an toolbox which allows users to upload an image, then edit and manipulating their image 
in a variety of ways. 

Currently the toolbox allows users to crop, scale, flip, rotate, apply zero padding, change the brightness,
change the contrast, apply filters, and detect edges in their images.
Additionally, the toolbox does not use pre-defined functions. Instead all image processing functionalities
are written using image processing principles and then implemented in the application with the use of 
functions found within the python file 'ImageToolbox.py'.

DearPyGui library was used to create the graphical user interface.
