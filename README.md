# Image Processing Toolbox

## How To Use
To begin using my toolbox the user must ensure that they are in the project directory 
which is named “TanyaNantsa_Toolbox”. The user must also ensure they have DearPyGui 
installed by typing ‘pip install dearpygui’ (this was the library used to create the 
graphical user interface). 

Then type ‘python3 ImageToolBox.py’ to launch the toolbox. The application will 
pop up in a new window.

To use the tools in the toolbox the user must first select an image from their 
own files to upload by pressing the “File Selector” button in the application. 
The next step is to select which tool the user wants to use on the image by 
clicking the corresponding tool button in the application.

To exit the toolbox application, click the X in the top left corner.
